There are many things I love about technology.  As it improves quickly through time it is always best to
stay on top of what the most current things are. 
I love the ability to program and make things easier for others that aren't as tech saavy.
I love seeing how it changes and the improvements, for example the differences between Windows 9 and 10.
They are subtle but great.  I liked 9 better but I will accept 10 and have become quite great using it.
Another thing I love about technology is how there are 'clouds' now; like Dropbox and the new Office365.
It allows information to move faster between phones, laptops, or any other platform. 

A really great thing that Google has is Google Photos.  Once they are loaded, no matter what platform you use 
to look at pictures, you will see them all synced perfectly.
